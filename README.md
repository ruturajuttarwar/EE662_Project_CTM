# EE662_Project_CTM
Python simulation of a self-organizing wireless sensor network with dynamic tree formation. Features automatic router promotion for multi-hop cluster head connectivity, hybrid CTM-AdHoc routing, and adaptive cluster management. Nodes self-organize into ROOT→ROUTER→CH→REGISTERED hierarchy with real-time visualization.
